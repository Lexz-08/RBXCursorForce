# RBXCursorForce
## Description
A program to force the cursor to the center of your Roblox game client window.<br><br>
*I only made this program because the Microsoft Store version of Roblox wasn't keeping my cursor within the window boundaries, so I made this program to force it.*<br><br>
***This program is meant to be used in conjunction with the shift-lock feature, or if you're holding down right-click in the case that shift-lock is unavailable. (aka, whenever you're moving the character or camera and not interacting with the GUI)***
